If you want a window manager that plays along well with it, have a look at [umberwm](https://github.com/yazgoo/umberwm/).

## prerequisites 

- for black (default) and white theme, you need [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed
- you need xterm (or urxvt) installed
- you need xrandr

## downloading

Binaries are available on [release page](https://github.com/yazgoo/umberbar/releases)

## configuration

By default, umberbar will create `~/.config/umberbar/umberbar.conf` with default theme.
To select a different theme use `-t <theme_name>` and to save it it to the configuration use `-s` (`-h` for more help).

Generated configuration will have comments discribing each fields.

You can also add additional configuration in `~/.config/umberbar/override.conf`.
This will allow you to switch themes via `-t` and `-s` without loosing your changes.
The configuration parameters you set in this file will override the ones in umberbar.conf.

For example, here are contents of my override.conf tailored for urxvt:

```
term=urxvt
terminal_width=241
font=FuraCode Nerd Font Mono
```

## running from binaries

```
./umberbar
``` 

## building / running it (crystal)

```
crystal build umberbar.cr
```

```
./umberbar
```

## running it (ruby)

```
./umberbar.rb
```

## using with urxvt

You can also use urxvt instead of xterm, which is nice becaues
urxvt has background transparency support.

Your urxvt version should also have truecolor enabled.

just run:

```
./umberbar -te urxvt
```

For nerd font to be fully operational, make sure the font you're using is monospaced.

## why does this project use crystal ?

crystal gives this project many advantages:

- type safety (because type checking makes everything safer and easier to reason with)
- nil protection (which is part of the type safety I guess)
- because we compile for crystal, those guarantees also translate to ruby runtime
- self contained binaries

## what are the painpoints of developing for both ruby and crystal ?

Although both languages are really close, crystal is not made to be compatible with ruby.
This project uses the lowest common denominator between those (so no macro, no introspection).
Where there were incompatibilites, we used the method `is_ruby?`.

Here is a list of incompatibilities and how we handle those:

  - `Time.now` does not exist in crystal so we use `date` command in ruby
  - `Process.exec` does not have the same exact interface
  - umberbar calls itself in xterm, we use `__FILE__` in ruby, `PROGRAM_NAME` in crystal
